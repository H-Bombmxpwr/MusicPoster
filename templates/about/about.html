        <!-- How It Works -->

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                When you search for an album, Album Poster connects to Spotify's API to fetch comprehensive 
                album data including high-resolution artwork, complete tracklists, artist information, and 
                release details.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tool then analyzes the album cover using advanced color extraction algorithms to identify 
                dominant colors. These colors are presented as suggestions, ensuring your poster maintains 
                visual harmony with the original artwork while giving you full creative control.
            </p>
            <p>
                Posters are rendered dynamically using Python's Pillow library, which enables precise 
                typography, layout composition, and high-quality image output. The result is a 
                professional-grade poster you can download instantly.
