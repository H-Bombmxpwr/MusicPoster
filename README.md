# MusicPoster
Makes a Music Poster given an album and an artist

#Usage
To generate the poster clone the code. You will need a `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET` which are the same as the spotify ones which you can get from spotify for developers [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/). 
Create a keys.env file in the main directory and set these two variables there.

Once this is done you can run app.py to get a localhosted site, or run test.py to make a poster without hosting a wesbite. 

For some examples see [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md)
