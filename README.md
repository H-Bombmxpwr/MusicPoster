- Total runtime of the album (minutes:seconds -> 54:45)
- Label the album was released under

You can change the text color, the background color, and the format of the tracks on the poster. 

# Website
You can make your own posters at the website [![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-AlbumPoster-brightgreen)](https://trevorg73.web.illinois.edu/musicposter/home). It will prompt for an artist and album. Suggestions will autofill based on what you have already entered. If you cannot get the search to work, pasting the Spotify album link into the album box will work 100% of the time. A plethora of examples can be seen [![Examples](https://img.shields.io/badge/Examples-brightgreen)](https://trevorg73.web.illinois.edu/musicposter/mosaic). Note the examples are of lower quality to save space. 


# Examples
Some examples are in [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md). A more extensive list of examples can be found [![Examples](https://img.shields.io/badge/Examples-brightgreen)](https://trevorg73.web.illinois.edu/musicposter/mosaic). 


# Printing
Almost everything generated by this program will be copyrighted material, which may be illegal to print and resell. Proceed at your own risk.


# Local Usage and Contribution
To generate the poster clone the code. You will need a `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET` which are the same as the spotify ones which you can get from spotify for developers [![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-SpotifyDev-1DB954)](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/). 
Remove the `.example` from [keys.env.example](keys.env.example) and add your own keys.

There is also a `requirements.txt` file to install the right dependencies using 
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once this is done you can run [app.py](app.py) to get a localhosted site, or run [local.py](local.py) to make a poster without hosting a website. You can change the album and artist in [local.py](local.py) as well. 

All that is required is to send in an artist and album(with close enough spelling) and the program will do the rest

# In the future
Stronger mobile support for the website
